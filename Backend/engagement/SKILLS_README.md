# Skills feature (scaffold)

This directory contains skeleton files for the `backend-skills` feature.

Files:
- `skills_models.py` - Skill model
- `skills_serializers.py` - DRF serializers
- `skills_views.py` - DRF viewset
- `skills_service.py` - service helpers
- `skills_signals.py` - signals scaffold
- `skills_tests.py` - basic tests

Next steps:
- Expand models to support endorsements, badges, and ranking
- Wire views into `engagement/leaderboard` if required
- Add migrations and run tests
